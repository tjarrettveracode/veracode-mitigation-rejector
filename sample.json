This information can be useful in executing other attacks and can also enable the attacker to target known vulnerabilities in application components. The first argument to print() contains data from an error message (possibly containing untrusted data) from the variable error. The data from an error message (possibly containing untrusted data) originated from an earlier call to java.lang.Throwable.getMessage.
